Installing METIS on Ubuntu: 
There are two main way, I would call them complicated but solid and the other one is the simple but it may not work:
1-
$ make config
$ make
$ make install
At this point every thing should work in case you ace the cmake and the other dependents. If it gives you a problem
then keep doing the coming step

$ export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$HOME/metis/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
$ source ~/.bashrc
up to this point it should work smoothly.

2- This is the simplest way ever to do this job
just run the following command
$ sudo apt-get install metis
